## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



# CVI - Chronic Venous Insufficiency

The objective is to analyze the venous diameter of the great saphenous vein of patients with chronic venous insufficiency stratified through the CEAP classification in relation to the body mass index.

Secondary objectives: <br>
- To analyze the relationship between body mass index and CEAP classification <br>
- To compare the CEAP classification with the venous diameter at the saphenous femoral junction and at the thigh <br>
- To compare the body mass index with the venous diameter at the femoral saphenous junction and at the thigh <br> <br>

Variables: <br>
- Research Registry (r) <br>
- Name name <br>
- Age age <br>
- Sex sex <br>
- Side side <br>
- CEAP classification ceap <br>
- CEAP classification ceap <br>
- Body mass index bmi <br>
- Body mass index categorizied bmic <br>
- Abdominal circumference abd_circum <br>
- Venous diameter at the femoral saphenous junction fsj <br>
- Venous diameter at the saphenous femoral sv
