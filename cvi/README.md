# CVI - Chronic Venous Insufficiency

The objective is to analyze the venous diameter of the great saphenous vein of patients with chronic venous insufficiency stratified through the CEAP classification in relation to the body mass index.

Secondary objectives:
- To analyze the relationship between body mass index and CEAP classification
- To compare the CEAP classification with the venous diameter at the saphenous femoral junction and at the thigh
- To compare the body mass index with the venous diameter at the femoral saphenous junction and at the thigh
