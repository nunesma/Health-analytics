### Description
This health analytics project intends to evaluate the influence of some social and economic indicators on life expectancy using a multiple linear regression model, aiming to establish elements for the planning of public policies related to the health care of the elderly population.

### Introduction:
Population aging is a global reality and has been considered a challenge for health systems. In Brazil, aging has complex dimensions due to the velocity with which it is occurring and is causing social and health impacts. For this reason, the planning of public policies adapted to these new challenges is so necessary.

### Objective:
This project intends to evaluate the influence of some social and economic indicators on life expectancy, aiming to establish elements for the planning of public policies related to the health care of the elderly population.

### Method:
This was an ecological study of the 75 municipalities that are part of the State of Sergipe, located in the Northeast region of Brazil and has a population of 2,068,017 inhabitants, of which 8.9% (185,957) are 60 years of age or older. <br>
In this evaluation the social, demographic and health indicators were analyzed and were collected through the Information System of the Ministry of Health (DATASUS) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) through the Brazilian Demographic Census at the level of disaggregation of the sectors Censuses. Elderly persons were those aged 60 or over, according to Brazilian legislation. <br> <br>
